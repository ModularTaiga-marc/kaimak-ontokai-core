## Basic Information

**Organization Name**: Atradius Crédito y Caución S.A. de Seguros y Reaseguros
**Acronyms**: Atradius Crédito y Caución, Crédito y Caución, CyC, Atradius Spain
**HQ Location**: Madrid, Méndez Álvaro

## Additional Context (Optional)

This is an example of **minimal input** provided to Kaimak to generate a comprehensive knowledge graph.

From just the company name and HQ location, the system should infer:
- Industry vertical (trade credit insurance & surety/bonding)
- Applicable jurisdictions and regulations (Spanish + EU)
- Typical business processes for credit insurers
- Data categories specific to trade credit (buyer ratings, exposures, collections)
- Technology assets
- Risks and controls
- Relationships between entities

This example was generated from a manual ChatGPT conversation to validate the core Kaimak hypothesis: that minimal company information can be expanded into a comprehensive, regulation-aware semantic layer.

The system correctly identified Atradius as a trade credit insurer (not general insurance), demonstrating domain-specific inference capability.
